# Java Library for 4chan

This is the source code for a current WIP library for the 4chan API. 
Feel free to download and test with the current limited functionality.

##How do I test this?
Right now I'm working on getting this project into the Maven Central Repository. For now, I've uploaded the .jar in the /docs directory.
